Originally I was interested in deploying a Jekyll site for work purposes since we're looking into moving off Wordpress and onto a static site generator. Wordpress has bogged me down over the years with it's excruciating software/security issues, poor PHP programming and general slowness. I thought that popping up my own site using a static generator would be a good test for understanding the ins and outs. It's also going to prove quite helpful for my son who has been nagging me to get a site/blogging option online for a while now for him. So...Jekyll it is then for the meanwhile.

I found that I did have some difficulties with the Github hosting and having to switch to the right branch etc which made it less than ideal to recommend to a newbie. As far as speed and efficiencies go, however, it is incredibly fast and lightweight. Major points on this.
